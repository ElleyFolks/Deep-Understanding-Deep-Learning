    "# Use an ANN model to Predict the Wine's Sugar Content\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "1. Adapt code to predict sugar instead of quality.\n",
    "2. Achieve as high of accuracy as possible for this problem.\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- #### This differs from the previous projects, because now the model will predict sugar content instead of the subjective wine quality.\n",
    "- #### Throughout this experiment, I'll be considering if the `quality` feature should be dropped. I would be interested to see if it harms or improves the model's performance.\n",
    "- #### May still need to run a parametric experiment to figure out a good batch size. From previous projects I think batch sizes of 32 or 64 would be most stable."
